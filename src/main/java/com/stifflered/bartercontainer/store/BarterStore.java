/**
 * Domain interface for a "barter store" â€“ a player-owned shop container.

 * A BarterStore encapsulates all the persistent and runtime state of a single shop:
 *   - Who owns it (player profile).
 *   - Its unique key for storage/caching.
 *   - The backing inventories (sale items and currency bank).
 *   - Current barter price (as an ItemStack, flexible beyond vanilla currencies).
 *   - Role-based access control (BarterRole).
 *   - Physical world locations (e.g., blocks that represent/compose this shop).

 * Implementations (e.g., {@link com.stifflered.bartercontainer.store.BarterStoreImpl}) handle
 * persistence, validation, and concrete inventory behavior.

 * Typical lifecycle:
 *   1. Created via BarterManager#createNewStore, written into block PDC.
 *   2. Cached in BarterManager#storage while chunk is loaded.
 *   3. Saved/unloaded on chunk unload or plugin shutdown.
