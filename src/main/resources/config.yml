# ==============================================================================
# 📦 Barter Chests — Configuration (types, numbers, formats only)
#
# This file now holds **structure-only** config:
#   • Item TYPES (Material IDs)
#   • Numeric ranges / toggles
#   • Time/date format patterns
#
# 📝 All player/GUI text, names, lore, and messages have moved to: messages.yml
#    (MiniMessage formatting lives there.)
